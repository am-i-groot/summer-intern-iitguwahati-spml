# Water Quality Monitoring System (WQMS) â€“ Summer Internship @ IIT Guwahati
This repository contains my work from the Summer Internship 2024 at IIT Guwahati, where I developed an advanced Water Quality Monitoring System (WQMS) under the mentorship of Dr. Hanumant Singh Shekhawat.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview
- Developed a Water Quality Monitoring System to enhance the accuracy of water quality assessments.

- Utilized the pH-W218 (8-in-1) sensor to collect and transfer data for multiple water samples.

- Applied Unsupervised Machine Learning (K-Means Clustering) to analyze water potability and interpret cluster centroids.

- Evaluated water quality by assessing key parameters: pH, TDS, EC, ORP, salinity, and temperature.

- Successfully completed the internship and received a certificate upon submitting the final report.

## ðŸ“Œ Technologies & Tools Used
- Hardware: pH-W218 Sensor

- Programming: Python

- Machine Learning: K-Means Clustering, Elbow Method, Silhouette Analysis

- Data Analysis: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

- Visualization: Seaborn, PCA for dimensionality reduction

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure
`/data` â€“ Collected water quality datasets

`/notebooks` â€“ Jupyter Notebooks for data preprocessing, clustering, and visualization

`/reports` â€“ Final report and presentation materials

## ðŸ“Š Key Findings
- Cluster 1: High-quality potable water with minimal impurities and balanced pH.

- Cluster 2: Poor water quality with high levels of dissolved solids, salinity, and contaminants.

- Cluster 3: Moderate water quality, requiring treatment for drinking purposes.
